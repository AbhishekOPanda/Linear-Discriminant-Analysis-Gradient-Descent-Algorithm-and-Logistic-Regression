# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-Gradient-Descent-Algorithm-and-Logistic-Regression

Problem 1:
Implement Linear Discriminant Analysis for each pair of the classes and report your results. Note that there are three (3) class labels in this data set. To implement these models, you can use python and the sklearn packages.

Problem 2:
Implement your Logistic regression classifier with ML estimator using Stochastic gradient descent and Mini-Batch gradient descent algorithms. Do not use any package/tool. Use cross-validation for evaluation and report the recall, precision, and accuracy on malignant class prediction (class label malignant is positive).
